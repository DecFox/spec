# Measurements and URL policy

* _status_: needs updating (it references the defunct governance roster for OPOS)

This document explains the policy we follow when considering what URLs and
Measurements should be scheduled via the OONI Probe Orchestration System (OPOS)
and/or any other system run by OONI to gather network measurement data.

1. To the extent that it is possible we will always do what is best for users of OONI.

2. When in doubt favour user safety.

3. Every action that leads to measurements being triggered by probes must be
   logged (either publicly or privately depending on what is safer for the
   user).

5. Measurements aimed at deanonymizing users shall never be scheduled.

5. A URL must first have been included as part of the
   [citizen-lab testing list](https://github.com/citizenlab/test-lists) repository to be
   considered for testing.

6. Only people in the governance roster can trigger measurements and a
   measurement must be signed off by at least one other person.

7. Anybody in the governance roster can nominate somebody else to join the
   roster. Their inclusion shall be discussed and once there is consensus they
   are added. To be included in the roster you need to:

   a. Have a legitimate reason to do so (ex. you do research on censorship)

   b. Be a respected member of the OONI community

8. If anybody suspects that any of these rules have not been followed or there
   is suspicion of abuse, please contact anybody in the Governance roster.
